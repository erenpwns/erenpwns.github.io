If you're diving into the world of custom mechanical keyboards, the **GMMK Pro** is hard to miss. It's become somewhat of a cult classic for beginners and intermediate enthusiasts alike. I recently built mine with **Akko V3 Cream Yellow switches**, and after a good amount of tweaking, I feel confident sharing my thoughts on the board.

## 🔧 Build & Mods

Out of the box, the GMMK Pro is built like a tank. The **aluminum case** has a premium weight and a clean, minimal aesthetic. However, as most of us know: stock doesn't cut it.

Here’s what I changed:

- **Switches**: Akko V3 Cream Yellow (pre-lubed, linear)
- **Stabilizers**: Replaced stock stabs with **Durock V2**, clipped and lubed
- **Foam**: Added **FoamWizard case foam** for sound dampening
- **Tape Mod**: 3 layers of masking tape on the PCB (classic "tape mod")
- **PE Foam Mod**: Thin foam between PCB and plate
- **Lubing**: Krytox 205g0 on switches & dielectric grease for stabilizers

## 🎧 Sound Profile

With the mods, the GMMK Pro delivers a **deep, creamy "thock"** that’s incredibly satisfying. The **Akko Cream Yellows** have a soft bottom-out and a buttery smoothness that pairs well with the tape and foam mods.

Before modding, the stock stabilizers were serviceable but nothing special. In fact, they were a little rattly and detracted from the overall sound profile. After swapping them for **Durock V2 stabilizers**, the difference was night and day — cleaner, tighter keystrokes and a far more refined acoustic experience.

## 🧠 Typing Feel

Typing on this board feels solid and cushioned. The combination of the **gasket-mounted design** and the foam layers produces minimal hollowness. There's a pleasant softness to the keystrokes without feeling mushy. The Akko switches offer just the right amount of resistance for fast typing while still feeling satisfying.

## ⚙️ Software: VIA... kinda

One of the biggest downsides of the GMMK Pro is its **incompatibility with standard VIA**. While it **does support QMK and a custom fork of VIA**, it's not plug-and-play like some other boards. You have to use Glorious’s VIA-compatible JSON file and manually load it into VIA every time you want to tweak your layout. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s far from ideal for people who love to experiment with layers and macros.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

All things considered, I’m super happy with how this build turned out. It’s a highly customizable board with a ton of potential — but you **do** need to put in some modding work to unlock its full capabilities.

If you're looking for a board that can deliver a **premium thocky experience**, the GMMK Pro (with the right mods) will definitely deliver. Just be aware of the software limitations and factor in a stabilizer swap as part of the budget.

### ⭐️ TL;DR

- **Sound**: Deep, creamy, and refined (after mods)
- **Feel**: Solid, cushioned, and smooth
- **Mods required?** Yes — especially stabilizers and foam
- **Software**: Not fully VIA-compatible (QMK/VIA fork only)
- **Would I recommend it?** Absolutely — with mods.
